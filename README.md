This is the code for the Weather App. Before you enter the "weather App" I would just like to say, honestly, that my project is not the best and 
perhaps does not meet the requriments given, but I really, really, really, tried my best on this project and throughout the entire course. I went from
knowing nothing in coding to understadning how to build a basic app, I have grown a lot, but even then this project was quite difficult for me and my level
of understanding of coding. I hope this "app" isn't horrible, And I know it doesn't seem like much, but even then, I am proud of what I accomplished. I hope 
you keep this in mind when viewing my app. Thankyou!!
